## Mysql database setup for Django

* Install dependencies.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Start your Mysql engine. For MacOS, Linux user to start the engine from command line.
```bash
sudo mysql.server start 
```

* Connect to your mysql. Create database and user. I recommend 
mysql-workbench. It is easy to use and it gives ok user interface.
